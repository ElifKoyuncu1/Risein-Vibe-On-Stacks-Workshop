## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m Elif Koyuncu, a 3rd-year Management Information Systems student from Gümüşhane University.  
I enjoy learning new technologies and experimenting with blockchain-based systems.  
Currently, I’m participating in the **Transition to Web3 Bootcamp @riseinweb3**.  
This project reflects my interest in decentralized applications and smart contract development.

## 🧠 Project Description

**Book Lending Tracker** is a decentralized web application that allows users to register books, lend them to others, and track the lending/return process — all on-chain.  
Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, the system ensures transparent and immutable lending records.  
It also includes a clean frontend built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## 🌍 Vision

We aim to replace centralized library and lending systems with transparent, verifiable blockchain-backed records.  
By enabling individuals and communities to manage book sharing independently, we promote trust and accessibility without intermediaries.

## 🛠 Development Plan

1. **Smart Contract** – Define book structure, lending and return functions (in Clarity)  
2. **Clarity Storage Map** – Track books and their lending status  
3. **Next.js Frontend** – Build basic UI to interact with contract  
4. **Connect Wallet** – Integrate Hiro Wallet for user authentication  
5. **Lend/Return Actions** – Create UI for adding, lending and returning books  
6. **Deployment** – Deploy frontend on Vercel and contract on Stacks Testnet

## 💬 Personal Story

While exploring blockchain technology during the bootcamp, I decided to apply it to a real-world scenario I care about: book sharing.  
This project allowed me to learn Clarity, smart contract basics, and how frontend and Web3 interact.  
It’s been both challenging and rewarding!
